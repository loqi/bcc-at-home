New teaching approach

I have been paying attention. I have learned from the past few sessions so I'm being agile and changing my approach. Thank you all for helping me do this.

The basic strategy I've been following is to teach the smallest elements of JavaScript, and then piece those elements together into bigger units until you understand how the whole language works. I think a better strategy would be to show a small piece of JavaScript code that does something, and then explain how that code does that thing. Rather than giving you everything about one feature of JavaScript before moving on to the next feature, I'll demonstrate something that uses a little bit of many features, and give you a tour of that thing. I think the approach I've been taking has been to give you too many concepts insufficiently grounded in how to use them or why they matter.

You're learning about JavaScript and I'm learning about teaching JavaScript. I would like you all to follow my example of experimentation and discovery in your own learning. We all have a lifetime of training with a certain educational model. In that traditional model we were trained as children not to experiment or take risks. We were trained to absorb knowledge handed down by an authority figure and then practice our skills and take tests full of questions that each have a right answer. Later we were given a choice of classes and trained to strive for high grades by only attempting classes that were not too challenging. That's not what we're here for. You are here to experiment and take risks. You are here to participate in the crafting of this curriculum while integrating coding skills into yourself. I am here to learn as much as you.

After you leave this class, you should be able to build things, but more importantly, you should be able to figure out how unfamiliar things work, while building things. Engineers spend a lot of time confused. When we find something new we figure out how it works, and then figure out how to make it better, and then figure out how build a better replacement for that thing. That involves being wrong a lot.

I want you to be wrong a lot.

When I ask you to guess what a piece of code is likely to do, I am not trying to prove you ignorant. Play is how we learn. Making wrong guesses and immediately testing our guess is very important for learning. If we make right guesses all the time, we're not learning something new! When practicing a sport, we get better by missing our target many times until we miss our target less. Guess at something you don't know, or it'll be like a practice session of basketball where you don't miss much by only taking easy shots. In a practice session, you should be missing your shots a lot. If not, you're practicing too easy. Missing a practice shot is not a cause for embarrassment, it's a cause for more practice.

My own shots have been missing. I'm changing my teaching approach.



Let's look at a piece of code you may not yet fully understand. This code finds the median value of an array of numbers. Given a list of numbers, the median is the number where half the numbers are higher and half are lower. If there are an odd number of numbers, it's the one in the middle. If there are an even number of numbers, it's the number halfway between the middle two numbers.

When you see syntax you are unfamiliar with, try to guess what it does and see how close your guess is to what it actually seems to do. I put a debugger statement in the code so you can paste it into a Chrome console and step through it while inspecting variables. Remember, you can highlight any expression big or small, and hover over the highlight to see the evaluation of that expression.

So here's the code:


var arrayOfNumbers = [5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
var median = null;
debugger;
var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
median = (midIndex % 1
    ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
console.log("The median of those numbers is " + median);


Paste it into a Chrome console and press enter. Try giving `arrayOfNumbers` a different set of numbers and see what changes in how it runs. Step and look at everything. When you feel you mostly understand how this code works, read on...



Here's that same code with line numbers.

    1  var arrayOfNumbers = [5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
    2  var median = null;
    3  debugger;
    4  var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    5  var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    6  median = (midIndex % 1
    7      ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    8      : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
    9  console.log("The median of those numbers is " + median);

Here's how it executes.

Line 1 creates a new variable named `arrayOfNumbers` and then assigns to it the value that results from evaluating the expression `[5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000]`. That expression is an array literal (we'll learn about these later) so an array gets built in memory with six number values in it. A reference to that new array gets written to the new variable as its initial value.

Line 2 creates a new variable `median` and assigns to it the result of the expression `null`. That expression is a single keyword that means "the null value". A copy of the null value gets written to the new variable as its initial value.

Line 3 is a keyword that invokes the JavaScript debugging functionality of the environment its running in. We're using Chrome, so the developer tools open the debugging window with execution paused on line 3. This is the default behavior for Chrome when it sees a `debugger` statement.

Line 4 creates a new variable `sortedAr` and assigns to it the result of the expression `arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b})`. That expression resolves to a sorted copy of the array referred to by the value in the `arrayOfNumbers` variable. We'll go into detail of how this works in a little bit, but for now it just works. We want a sorted array so we can find the middle elements, and we want a copy of the array so we don't mess up the original array we were given.

Line 5 creates a new variable `midIndex` and loads it with the result of `sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5`. Division gets priority over subtraction and we happen to know that `sortedAr` has a length of 6 right now, so that expression resolves to (6/2 - 0.5) and then (3 - 0.5) and then (2.5).

Lines 6..8 form a statement made of one big expression. If the array [5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000] is in memory and arrayOfNumbers has a reference to it; and the array [-3, 0, 5, 12, 17.28, 5000] is in memory and sortedAr has a reference to it; and midIndex has the number 2.5; then the expression
    median = (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   )
evaluates like this
    median = (   2.5   % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(   2.5  )] + sortedAr[Math.floor(  2.5   +1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[  2.5   ]   )
and then this
    median = (      0.5
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(   2.5  )] + sortedAr[Math.floor(  2.5   +1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[  2.5   ]   )
The number 0.5 is not zero, so the ternary operation sees it as the boolean true value
    median = (      true
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(   2.5  )] + sortedAr[Math.floor(  2.5   +1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[  2.5   ]   )
which evaluates the expression to
    median = (sortedAr[Math.floor(2.5)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(2.5 + 1)]) / 2
Math.floor is a built-in JavaScript function that rounds numbers down to the next lower integer. Math.floor(2.99) is 2.0 and Math.floor(-3.01) is -4.0
    median = (sortedAr[Math.floor(2.5)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(2.5 + 1)]) / 2
    median = (sortedAr[       2.0     ] + sortedAr[Math.floor(2.5 + 1)]) / 2
    median = (sortedAr[       2.0     ] + sortedAr[Math.floor(   3.5  ]) / 2
    median = (sortedAr[       2.0     ] + sortedAr[        3.0        ]) / 2
    median = (            5             +               12             ) / 2
    median =                            17                               / 2
    median =                            8.5
The `=` operator means overwrite whatever's in median with the number 8.5 and resolve `median = 8.5` to just the number 8.5 after doing so. Since this concludes the evaluation of that three-line expression, and the semicolon says that expression is the entire statement, that number 8.5 in the expression accumulator is just discarded. The effect of computing that number and remembering it by assigning a copy to the variable `median` have already taken place during expression evaluation.

Now we have reached line 9, `console.log("The median of those numbers is " + median);` There exists a variable `console` already set up by the Chrome browser. In there is a key "log" which has a reference to a function. If you go searching in `console` for a property "log":something you won't find it because there's another lookup mechanism we haven't yet learned. The interpreter can find the function and pass in the evaluation of `"The median of those numbers is " + median` which is a string literal a plus sign and a variable with a number inside. Bivalent plus with a string and a number causes string concatenation. The number 8.5 is coerced to the string "8.5" and a new string is created with those two strings concatenated into one string. This string is passed to the console.log() function, which knows what to do with it, logging a message to the console built from the string it receives.



Okay, that code works for finding the median of an array, but suppose we want to find the median of two arrays. We could write code like this.

var arrayOfNumbers = [5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
var median = null;
var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
median = (midIndex % 1
    ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
console.log("First median: " + median);

var arrayOfNumbers = [0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
var median = null;
var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
median = (midIndex % 1
    ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
console.log("Second median: " + median);

This code will run just fine, however it's very bad design to have two identical, or even similar copies of code. It's wasteful of resources. Worse, the two passages of code can diverge from one another if someone edits one but not the other. These pieces of code might even be far apart in different files. And we might want to find the median of a third, fourth, or millionth array.

Your assignment is to write a function that, given an array of numbers, returns the median of that list of numbers. Try to refactor this code into a single function that's called twice. Work on this until you succeed or get stuck and then go on to the next reading to see just enough to get unstuck and keep trying. Struggling with making these things yourself is important to learning it deeply.
