Here's the original code to be refactored into one function called twice:


var arrayOfNumbers = [5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
var median = null;
var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
median = (midIndex % 1
    ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
console.log("First median: " + median);

var arrayOfNumbers = [0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
var median = null;
var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
median = (midIndex % 1
    ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
console.log("Second median: " + median);



Here is the code that seems to me to be a sensible median function:

var median = null;
var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
median = (midIndex % 1
    ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
    : sortedAr[midIndex]   );

The first line of the original code set up the array of numbers and the last line below reported the results of the median search to the console. The rest is the code that finds a median value.

I'll give the function the name `median`. We already have a variable by that name so we'll have to work around that. Here's how to put it into a named function:

function median(arrayOfNumbers) {
    var median = null;
    var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    median = (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
}

This will work, but creating a variable name inside a function that matches the function's name feels a bit risky. I'll change that name:

function median(arrayOfNumbers) {
    var result = null;
    var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    result = (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
}

We're computing the median, but unless we return it, the calling expression will resolve to the undefined value.

function median(arrayOfNumbers) {
    var result = null;
    var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    result = (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
    return result;
}

So that creates a working function, but that function never gets run. Here's some code to create the function and then immediately invoke it a couple of times.

var ar;
function median(arrayOfNumbers) {
    var result = null;
    var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    result = (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
    return result;
}
ar = [5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
console.log(median(ar) + " is the median of " + ar);
ar = [0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000];
console.log(median(ar) + " is the median of " + ar);

That looks pretty good to me, but it still has repeated code. I'm going to factor out another function.

function median(arrayOfNumbers) {
    var result = null;
    var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    result = (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
    return result;
}
function logMedian(ar) {
    console.log(median(ar) + " is the median of " + ar);
}
debugger; // Use "step into" to pause inside logMedian() and median().
logMedian([5, 0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000]);
logMedian([0, 12, -3, 17.28, 5000]);

If you use "step into" you'll pause inside logMedian() and then inside median(). You may also pause inside some scaffolding code for the debugger, or JavaScript as well. Don't panic when that happens. Take a look around if you're feeling adventurous with some stepping and variable inspection. If you're not feeling so inclined, use "step out", which means run the paused function until it's time to return from it and then pause in the code that called this code. The console.log() function was not written by you but stepping into it reveals the scaffolding code. It'll be weird to you, but you can make some sense of it with your current level of skill.



Let's make the median function better. The variable `result` doesn't get used much. We don't really need it:

function median(arrayOfNumbers) {
    var sortedAr = arrayOfNumbers.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    return (midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
}

What if `median` is given an empty array? Would that function produce the right result for that argument? Let's try it. Copy that new median function into the clipboard and then paste it into console and press enter. Now type this into the console, guessing what will happen each time before pressing enter:

> median([])

> logMedian([])

The `logMedian` function is still in memory, and the `logMedian` variable is still pointing to that function. When that function runs, it looks up the variable `median` which it expects to have a reference to a function, and it calls that function, passing it an argument that it received as the first parameter of `logMedian`. All these names and objects are still where they belong, so everything still works as expected. Well, maybe not everything. The median function may be returning the wrong result when given an empty array.

Let's try a few more unexpected inputs. Guess what happens with these:

> logMedian("")

We get an error message. `concat` is a method of String that returns another String, but `sort` is not a method of String.

> logMedian(["a", "e", "b", "c", "d"])

We get the middle element "b" because the sort seemed to have no effect.

The usual way to handle these problems is either
    1. Tolerate them. Expect only good values and don't waste any effort checking them.
    2. Check for problematic data or data types and account for them somehow.

Choose option 1 if you want simpler code and faster performance. Choose option 2 if your code is meant for the outside world to use and not just to be used by code written by you. Be nice to other programmers if you want to publish your function for them to use. Don't choke on broken inputs.

Let's do some error checking and lightweight documentation so the rest of the world can use our awesome `median` function.

/* Given an array of numbers, returns the median of those numbers.
 * If there are an even number of values, returns the mean of the middle two.
 * Returns null if the function is passed something other than an array or
 * is passed an empty array. Does not mutate the original array.
 */
function median(unsortedAr) {
    if (!Array.isArray(unsortedAr)) return null;
    var sortedAr = unsortedAr.concat().sort(function(a,b){return a<b ? -1 : +(a>b)});
    var midIndex = sortedAr.length / 2 - 0.5;
    return ( midIndex % 1
        ? (sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex)] + sortedAr[Math.floor(midIndex+1)]) / 2
        : sortedAr[midIndex]   );
}

Paste that into the console and press enter. You'll get this coming back:

< undefined

Why undefined? Because the `function` keyword returns undefined when you run it as a statement. Same with `var` and other non-expression statements.

Let's play with that a bit.

> var myAlternateNameForMedian = median;
< undefined

That came back with undefined for the same reason. Remember, that `=` is not the `=` operator, it's part of the special `var` statement syntax.

> myAlternateNameForMedian = median
< function median(unsortedAr)

That one comes back with a little description of a function. Your exact text of the function description may vary by the version of your developer tools. It means the expression was evaluated and the final value of that expression was a reference to a function. The actual content of the variable does not vary by version of your development tools. It's always a real object reference to a function somewhere in memory. `median` is a variable and that variable already has a reference to the function we made earlier. The `=` is the assign operator, so it writes that reference to overwrite whatever was in `myAlternateNameForMedian`, which happens to be that same value this time. And that whole expression resolves to the value that just got written to that variable, which is what is reported on the next line. The way the Chrome console reports a reference to a function is in the form shown.

> myAlternateNameForMedian([5, 9, 3, 8, 1])
< 5
> median([5, 9, 3, 8, 1])
< 5

So now we have a more robust median function in memory, referenced by the variable `median`. It's got a nice header comment so we can publish it for other programmers to use without first having to figure out what the code does. It ensures the argument it received is actually an array. I also changed the sort function to correctly sort an array of all strings as well as an array of all numbers. I still haven't explained how this works. Just trust that line for now.

Let's enter some console commands (executable JavaScript statements) and guess what happens before pressing enter:

> logMedian([1.1, 5.5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4])
> logMedian(["a", "e", "b", "c", "d"])
> logMedian("This is not an array.")
> logMedian()  // causes `unsortedString` to have the undefined value
> logMedian([])
> logMedian(["a", "e", "b", "c", "d", "f"]) // even number of elements

Alright, the last two are still a bit strange.

DO THIS:
Modify the `median` function so it returns null when an empty array is passed in.

The documentation says "Given an array of numbers." An array of strings is not an array of numbers. We can just allow the behavior be undefined (we don't guarantee what happens) when the input values are not as expected, or we can produce an approximate result, like one of the near-middle values if it's not all numbers in there, or we can enforce the requirement that every single value in the array must be a number. Perhaps you have another idea altogether. The point is, we should think a bit about weird arguments and have a reasonable response to them.

DO THIS:
It's time for you to decide what would be a reasonable behavior in the case of an array of values that are not all numbers. Write code or change the comments to support your choice and then test your function by calling it with a parameter that might cause the wrong behavior. Be sure to test with odd-length, even-length, and zero-length arrays and test with non-arrays.

DO THIS:
Make a min and max function that works like median: `min` finds the least value on the list. and `max` finds the greatest.
    /* Documentation here */
    function min(unsortedAr) {
        // Code here
    }
    /* Documentation here */
    function max(unsortedAr) {
        // Code here
    }
Give them good documentation and ensure they do something reasonable when weird values are passed in. Wherever practical, make the documentation say what the function does with weird values.
