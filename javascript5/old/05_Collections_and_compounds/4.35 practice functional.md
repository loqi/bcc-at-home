In JavaScript, not all arguments are required, and excess arguments are tolerated, so you can pass in a function that doesn't use all the arguments. If there are more parameters than arguments, the left-side parameters get populated, and the extra parameters are left undefined. If there are more arguments than parameters, the extra arguments are discarded.

Here is a bit of code to total up all the values of an array.

    var ar = [ 5, 0.9, 12.2, 71, -20 ];
    var sum;
    for (var i = 1; i <= ar.length; ++i) {
      // Put code here to total up a sum. Fix any bugs you see.
    }
    console.log("inline-coded sum " + sum);

Now refactor that code into a function `arraySum` to make these lines work:
    console.log("function call sum #1: " + arraySum( [-2.4] ));
    console.log("function call sum #2: " + arraySum( [] ));
    console.log("function call sum #3: " + arraySum( [5, 12, -40] ));
You can throw away and re-use any of the previous code you want. Just get the above lines to do what seems right to you by writing a function to do the summing work.

Add some error checking that seems reasonable to you until these do what you think is right:
    console.log("function call sum #4: " + arraySum( 3 ));
    console.log("function call sum #5: " + arraySum( [ "3" ] ));
    console.log("function call sum #6: " + arraySum( [ 1, "2", 3] ));
    console.log("function call sum #7: " + arraySum( [ 1, "too", 3] ));

Now write a method named `arrayProduct` that takes an array and returns the cumulative product of all the elements of that array. Make it work with these lines in a way that seems reasonable:
    console.log("product #1: " + arrayProduct( [-2.4] );
    console.log("product #2: " + arrayProduct( [] );
    console.log("product #3: " + arrayProduct( [5, 12, -40] );

Now you should have two functions that were declared by code that follows one of these basic forms:
    var arraySum = function() { /* bla bla bla */ };
    var arrayProduct = function() { /* yadda yadda yadda */ };
or
    function arraySum() { /* bla bla bla */ }
    function arrayProduct() { /* yadda yadda yadda */ }

Try rewriting your `arraySum` and `arrayProduct` functions with functional programming, so they each call this function to do their work:

    /* Given an array, a function, and an initial value, this function runs that passed-in
     * function against each element of the array. The function provided is iteratively called
     * with up to four arguments. The first argument is the initial or running accumulator, the
     * second argument is the iteratively selected element of the array, third is the index
     * of that element, and fourth is the entire array. 
     * Returns the
     * resulting accumulator value after performing the function call once per array element.
     * Default initial accumulator value is 0.
     */
    function arrayReduce(array, func, accum) {
        if (accum === undefined) accum = 0;
        for (var i =  /* bla bla bla */    ; ++i) {
            accum = func(accum, array[i], i, array);
        }
        return accum;
    }

    /* Given an array, return the cumulative sum of that array.
    */
    function arraySum(arrray){ return arrayReduce(function(a,b){return a+b;}); }

    /* Given an array, return the cumulative product of that array.
    */
    function arrayProduct(){   /* ***your code here*** */  }
