Correction from an October 7 chapter:

> Arithmetic on positive or negative floating-point numbers of trillions
> or smaller (within trillions of zero) will always be exact.

Here's the corrected passage:

A number value can represent any one numerical value, or any of a few special values like NaN, -0, +0, -Infinity, +Infinity. Due to quirks in how floating point numbers work, fractional arithmetic is often only an estimation, and not even the closest possible estimation. Arithmetic on positive or negative floating-point integer values of trillions or smaller (-1.8e+16 .. +1.8e+16) will always be exact.

> 1.0 + 2.0 === 3.0
< true
